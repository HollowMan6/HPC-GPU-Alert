Without the assistance of others, this thesis would not have come to fruition:

First and foremost, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Bernd Dammann, and my advisor, Dr. Sami Ilvonen, for generously allocating time amidst their busy schedules to organize bi-weekly meetings throughout the thesis writing phase. Their invaluable advice has been instrumental in shaping this work. I would also like to thank Prof. Bo Zhao and my advisor, Dr. Sebastian von Alfthan, for their unwavering guidance and support.

I sincerely thank CSC -- IT Center for Science Ltd. for sponsoring this thesis project. I also want to thank the SECCLO Erasmus Mundus Program for granting me a full-ride scholarship, which covered my living expenses during my two-year journey at Aalto University and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

Last but certainly not least, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my family and friends whose unwavering love and support sustained me throughout my master's degree journey over the past two years.

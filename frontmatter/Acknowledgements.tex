Without the assistance of others, this thesis would not have come to fruition:

First and foremost, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Bernd Dammann, and my advisor, Dr. Sami Ilvonen, for generously allocating time amidst their busy schedules to organize bi-weekly meetings throughout the thesis writing phase. Their invaluable advice has been instrumental in shaping this work. I would also like to thank Prof. Bo Zhao and my advisor, Dr. Sebastian von Alfthan, for their unwavering guidance and support. Special thanks to my colleague, Mr. Robin Karlsson, who helped me deploy the job graph and alert dashboard to CSC's Open OnDemand. Also, Mr. Simon Westersund and Dr. Mats Sj√∂berg gave me invaluable feedback on the dashboard design and usability of the system in production.

I sincerely thank CSC -- IT Center for Science Ltd. for sponsoring this thesis project. I also want to thank the SECCLO Erasmus Mundus Program for granting me a full-ride scholarship, which covered my living expenses during my two-year journey at Aalto University and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

Last but certainly not least, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my family and friends whose unwavering love and support sustained me throughout my journey over the past two years.
